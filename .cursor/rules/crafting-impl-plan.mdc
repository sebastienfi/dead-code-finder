# Working with an implementation plan

- Usually the file is located at the root of the project, and name `implementation-plan.md`.
- Update the document to report on your progress. 
- Remove details of code once you've implemented in files.
- Use sequential thinking mcp tool if you need to resolve multi step problems.
- Cradt the implmentation plan with great details because it will be implemented by an expert developper who don't know anything about our project.
