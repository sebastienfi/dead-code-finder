# Progress Tracking

## What's Working
- Project planning and architecture definition
- Memory bank documentation setup
- Research into dead code detection tools

## Current Status
- Project is in planning phase
- Documentation of architecture and approach in progress
- No code implementation started yet

## What's Next
- Setting up the development environment
- Creating the initial extension structure
- Implementing core interfaces

## Open Tasks

### Phase 1: Research & Setup
- [x] Research dead code detection tools for Python
- [x] Define high-level architecture
- [x] Document project requirements and approach
- [ ] Set up development environment with Yeoman generator
- [ ] Create initial extension structure
- [ ] Define core interfaces for analyzers

### Phase 2: Core Python Implementation
- [ ] Implement Python environment detection
- [ ] Create Vulture integration
- [ ] Develop result parsing and data structures
- [ ] Handle configuration and settings

### Phase 3: UI/UX Development
- [ ] Implement TreeView for displaying results
- [ ] Add context menu actions
- [ ] Create status bar integration
- [ ] Implement result filtering

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Develop test Python projects with dead code
- [ ] Optimize performance for large projects
- [ ] Add error handling and logging

### Phase 5: Documentation & Release
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Create README and examples
- [ ] Prepare for marketplace publication

## Known Issues
- None at this stage since implementation hasn't started

## Project Milestones
- [ ] Initial project setup and scaffold
- [ ] First successful dead code detection
- [ ] Working UI display of results
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] First public release
