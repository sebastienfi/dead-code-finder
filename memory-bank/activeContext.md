# Active Context

## Current Status
The project is in the initial planning phase. We are defining the architecture, technical approach, and implementation plan for the Dead Code Finder VSCode extension.

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use Vulture as the primary tool for Python dead code detection
- Chosen TypeScript as the implementation language for the extension
- Selected a modular architecture to support multiple languages in the future
- Determined that a TreeView-based UI is the best approach for displaying results

## Current Focus
- Defining the detailed project plan with task breakdown
- Researching VSCode extension development best practices
- Planning the core extension structure and interfaces
- Documenting the technical approach and architecture

## Next Steps
1. Set up the initial extension scaffolding using VSCode's Yeoman generator
2. Implement the core TypeScript interfaces for the analyzer system
3. Create the Python analyzer with Vulture integration
4. Develop the TreeView UI for displaying results
5. Add command handlers for triggering analysis and navigating to dead code

## Open Questions
- How to handle false positives in dead code detection?
- What's the best approach for Python environment detection?
- Should we provide automatic installation of Vulture if not present?
- How granular should the results be (functions, classes, methods)?
- What filtering options should be available in the UI?

## Learnings & Insights
- Vulture is the most mature tool for Python dead code detection
- VSCode extensions can use child processes to integrate with external tools
- A modular architecture is essential for future language support
- The Language Server Protocol may be useful for more advanced language integrations in the future
