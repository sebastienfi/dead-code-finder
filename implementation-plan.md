# Dead Code Finder - Implementation Plan

Last updated: April 4, 2024
Branch: main

## Purpose & Vision
The Dead Code Finder extension aims to help developers maintain clean, efficient codebases by identifying and removing unused code. By providing a seamless way to detect dead methods and functions directly within VSCode, the extension will reduce technical debt and improve code maintainability. Success will be measured by the extension's ability to accurately identify dead code with minimal false positives, while maintaining good performance even on large projects.

## Progress Summary
- Initial architecture and technical approach defined
- Research into Python dead code detection tools completed
- Project documentation in memory-bank established
- Next steps focus on setting up the development environment and implementing core functionality

## Current Context
We're building a VSCode extension to detect dead code (unused methods/functions) in Python projects, with future plans to expand to other languages. The extension will use Vulture for Python analysis, display results in a custom tree view, and allow navigation to the dead code for review or removal.

## Next Steps
1. Set up the VSCode extension development environment
2. Create the initial extension structure and scaffolding
3. Implement core interfaces for the analyzer system
4. Develop the Python analyzer with Vulture integration
5. Create the UI components for displaying results

## Code Quality Standards
- No backward compatibility layers
- No deprecated code
- No TODOs in final state
- Clean separation between analyzer interface and implementations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Architecture Overview
The extension follows a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Core Extension Layer**
   - Extension activation and command registration
   - Configuration management
   - Analyzer coordination

2. **Analyzer Interface Layer**
   - Common interface for all language analyzers
   - Result data structures
   - Analysis coordination

3. **Language-Specific Analyzers**
   - Python analyzer using Vulture
   - Future: Rust, TypeScript, etc.

4. **UI Layer**
   - TreeView for result display
   - Status bar integration
   - Navigation commands

5. **Utility Layer**
   - Process execution
   - File system operations
   - Logging

## Development Workflow
1. Implement core interfaces first
2. Build Python analyzer with Vulture integration
3. Create UI components
4. Add configuration and settings
5. Implement navigation and actions
6. Create tests and documentation
7. Refine and optimize

## Future Expansion
- Add support for Rust (potentially using rust-analyzer)
- Add support for TypeScript (using built-in TS server)
- Enhanced result visualization (graphs, heatmaps)
- Automatic dead code removal
