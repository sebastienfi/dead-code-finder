# Product Context

## Product Purpose
The Dead Code Finder extension addresses the common challenge of maintaining clean codebases by identifying unused methods and functions. Over time, codebases often accumulate dead code as features evolve, requirements change, and multiple developers contribute. This dead code:

- Increases cognitive load when reading the codebase
- Makes maintenance more difficult
- Can lead to bugs when partially refactored
- Consumes unnecessary resources during testing and compilation

The extension provides a streamlined way to identify and navigate to these unused methods, allowing developers to confidently remove them or document why they exist.

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Analysis should be triggered with a single command
- Results should be clear and immediately actionable
- Integration with the existing VSCode workflow

### Performance
- Analysis should run in the background without blocking the editor
- Results should update incrementally when possible
- Resource usage should be minimal

### Accuracy
- False positives should be minimized
- Confidence levels should be provided when appropriate
- Whitelisting mechanism for intentional unused code

### Integration
- Works within existing Python development workflows
- Complements other code quality tools
- Familiar VSCode UI patterns

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Code Cleanup**: Developers wanting to reduce technical debt by removing unused code.
2. **Codebase Exploration**: New team members trying to understand which parts of a codebase are actually used.
3. **Refactoring Support**: Identifying unused methods before undertaking large refactoring efforts.
4. **Code Quality Automation**: Teams including dead code checks as part of their quality processes.

## User Workflow

1. Open a Python project in VSCode
2. Trigger the "Find Dead Code" command
3. Review results in the extension's sidebar view
4. Navigate to specific instances of dead code
5. Make informed decisions about removing or keeping the code
6. Refresh analysis as needed after making changes

## Future User Enhancements

- Integration with git blame to show when the dead code was last modified and by whom
- Automatic PR generation for dead code removal
- Historical tracking of dead code over time
- Batch operations for handling multiple instances of dead code
