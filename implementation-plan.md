# Implementation Plan

Last updated: April 4, 2024
Branch: main

## Purpose & Vision
The Dead Code Hunter extension aims to help developers maintain clean, efficient codebases by identifying and removing unused code. By providing a seamless way to detect dead methods and functions directly within VSCode, the extension will reduce technical debt and improve code maintainability. Success will be measured by the extension's ability to accurately identify dead code with minimal false positives, while maintaining good performance even on large projects.

## Progress Summary
- Core architecture implemented and successfully compiled
- Python analyzer with Vulture integration implemented
- TreeView UI for displaying results created
- Command handlers for analysis and navigation implemented
- Extension configuration defined
- Next steps focus on testing with real Python projects and adding resource files

## Current Context
We have created a VSCode extension to detect dead code (unused methods/functions) in Python projects. The extension uses Vulture for Python analysis, displays results in a custom tree view, and allows navigation to the dead code for review or removal. The core functionality is implemented and compiles successfully.

## Next Steps
1. Create resource files for icon display
2. Create sample Python projects with dead code for testing
3. Add support for whitelisting intentional dead code
4. Implement diagnostics provider for inline warnings
5. Add unit tests for the core functionality

## Code Quality Standards
- No backward compatibility layers
- No deprecated code
- No TODOs in final state
- Clean separation between analyzer interface and implementations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Current Challenges
- ThemeIcon issues in the TreeView implementation had to be removed
- Need to create resource files for custom icons
- Testing with real Python projects to verify Vulture integration
- Handling false positives in dead code detection

## Next Milestone
Complete the testing infrastructure and create sample Python projects to validate the extension functionality in real-world scenarios.
