# Dead Code Finder - Project Plan

## Purpose & Vision
The Dead Code Finder extension identifies unused code in software projects, helping developers maintain clean codebases by detecting dead methods and functions. The primary goals are:

- Reduce technical debt by identifying unused code
- Improve maintainability and readability of codebases
- Prevent unnecessary bloat in projects
- Integrate seamlessly with VSCode's development workflow

## Progress Summary

### Completed Features
- âœ… Core architecture with analyzer interfaces
- âœ… Python analyzer with Vulture integration
- âœ… TreeView UI for result visualization
- âœ… Command handlers for analyzing workspace and files
- âœ… Navigation to dead code locations
- âœ… Custom SVG icons for tree items
- âœ… Whitelist generation for intentional dead code
- âœ… Diagnostics provider for inline warnings
- âœ… Sample Python project with intentional dead code
- âœ… Unit tests for core components
- âœ… UI improvements for the Dead Code panel (icon buttons)
- âœ… Fixed Vulture installation process

### Current Context
The extension can now detect dead code in Python projects using Vulture, display results in both a tree view and as inline diagnostics, and generate whitelists for intentional dead code. The core architecture is extensible for adding support for additional languages in the future.

Recent improvements have fixed UI issues with the panel buttons, which now use icons instead of text to save space. The Vulture installation process has also been enhanced with better error handling, fallback methods, and clearer user guidance.

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. âœ… Fix UI issues with the Dead Code panel buttons
2. âœ… Fix Vulture installation issue
3. Create a README.md for the extension
4. Add more comprehensive unit tests
5. Implement error handling for edge cases
6. Add icons for the extension in the marketplace
7. Set up a CI pipeline for automated testing

### Medium-term Tasks
1. Support for additional languages (JavaScript/TypeScript)
2. Add statistics view for dead code metrics
3. Improve configuration options for analysis
4. Create a changelog for version tracking

### Long-term Vision
1. Machine learning to reduce false positives
2. Integration with other code quality tools
3. Automatic refactoring suggestions for dead code removal
4. Support for advanced language-specific features
