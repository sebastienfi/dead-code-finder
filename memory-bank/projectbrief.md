# Dead Code Finder - VSCode Extension

## Project Overview
Dead Code Finder is a Visual Studio Code extension that identifies and displays methods not called from anywhere in a project. The extension focuses initially on Python projects with a plan to expand to other languages in the future, including Rust and TypeScript.

## Core Requirements
1. Detect unused methods/functions in Python code
2. Display results in a sidebar view within VSCode
3. Allow navigation to the dead code from the results
4. Provide configuration options for analysis settings
5. Design with extensibility for future language support

## Technical Approach
- Leverage existing dead code detection tools (like Vulture for Python)
- Implement a modular architecture allowing for language-specific analyzers
- Use TypeScript for extension development
- Follow VSCode extension best practices for UI/UX

## Target Users
- Python developers wanting to clean up their codebases
- Teams looking to improve code quality and reduce maintenance burden
- Future: Developers working with multiple languages

## Success Criteria
- Accurately identify unused methods in Python code
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface for viewing results
- Minimal performance impact on VSCode
- Extensible architecture for adding new languages
